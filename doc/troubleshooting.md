# Troubleshooting

## I can't connect to the REPL

 Please check the Configuration settings, the host and port should match the ones from your REPL server.

## Shortcuts are not working

 Shortcuts in IntelliJ can not work for different reasons, like Conflicting shortcuts of different plugins or keystroke not reaching IDE due to an external program. 
 Follow the [Keyboard Shortcuts Troubleshooting](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/keyboard-shortcuts-troubleshooting.html) guide to solve your issue. If they do not work, please open [an issue](https://github.com/afucher/clojure-repl-intellij/issues)
 
## Finding logs

You can access the IntelliJ logs from the menu `Help > Show Log in Finder` or `Help > Show Log in Explorer` depending on your OS.
